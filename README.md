## Security Testing Capabilities

### Scan Depths
1. **Basic Scan**: Essential security checks
2. **Standard Scan**: Comprehensive vulnerability testing
3. **Comprehensive Scan**: Advanced security analysis
4. **Penetration Test**: Full security assessment

### Vulnerability Categories
- **Injection Attacks**: SQL injection, NoSQL injection, command injection
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: Reflected, stored, and DOM-based XSS
- **Authentication Issues**: Bypass attempts, weak session management
- **Authorization Flaws**: Privilege escalation, insecure direct object references
- **Security Misconfigurations**: Missing headers, exposed services
- **Information Disclosure**: Directory traversal, sensitive data exposure
- **Network Security**: Port scanning, SSL/TLS analysis

### Scoring System
- **Score Range**: 20-90 out of 100
- **20-40**: High security risk (Critical vulnerabilities present)
- **40-60**: Moderate security risk (Several vulnerabilities found)
- **60-80**: Good security posture (Minor issues to address)
- **80-90**: Excellent security (Well-secured system)

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Modern web browser
- Internet connection (for target scanning)

### Backend Setup
1. **Install Python dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the Flask backend**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
   The backend will start on `http://localhost:5000`

### Frontend Setup
1. **Open the web application**:
   - Simply open `index.html` in your web browser
   - Or serve it through a web server for better performance

2. **Access the application**:
   - Frontend: Open `index.html` in your browser
   - Backend API: `http://localhost:5000`

## Usage

### Starting a Security Scan
1. **Configure Target**:
   - Enter the target URL (e.g., `https://example.com`)
   - Select target type (Member Portal, E-commerce, etc.)
   - Choose scan depth (Basic, Standard, Comprehensive, Penetration)

2. **Monitor Progress**:
   - Watch real-time scan progress
   - View individual test results
   - Track vulnerability discoveries

3. **Review Results**:
   - Overall security score (20-90/100)
   - Detailed vulnerability breakdown
   - Category-wise analysis
   - Specific recommendations

### Understanding Results

#### Security Score
- **90+**: Excellent security posture
- **80-89**: Good security with minor improvements needed
- **60-79**: Moderate security risk
- **40-59**: High security risk
- **20-39**: Critical security vulnerabilities

#### Vulnerability Severity
- **Critical**: Immediate attention required (Authentication bypass, RCE)
- **High**: Significant risk (SQL injection, XSS)
- **Medium**: Moderate risk (Missing headers, CSRF)
- **Low**: Minor issues (Information disclosure)

#### Recommendations
- Prioritized action items based on findings
- Specific implementation guidance
- Best practices for security improvement

## API Endpoints

### Scan Management
- `POST /api/scan` - Start new security scan
- `GET /api/scan/<scan_id>/status` - Get scan progress
- `GET /api/scan/<scan_id>/results` - Get scan results
- `DELETE /api/scan/<scan_id>` - Cancel active scan
- `GET /api/scans` - List all scans

### Example API Usage
```javascript
// Start a scan
const response = await fetch('http://localhost:5000/api/scan', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({
        target_url: 'https://example.com',
        target_type: 'member-portal',
        scan_depth: 'standard'
    })
});

// Monitor progress
const status = await fetch(`http://localhost:5000/api/scan/${scanId}/status`);
const results = await fetch(`http://localhost:5000/api/scan/${scanId}/results`);
```

## Security Considerations

### Ethical Use
- **Authorized Testing Only**: Only test systems you own or have explicit permission to test
- **Legal Compliance**: Ensure compliance with local laws and regulations
- **Responsible Disclosure**: Report vulnerabilities through proper channels

### Rate Limiting
- Built-in delays between requests to avoid overwhelming targets
- Configurable timeout settings
- Respectful scanning practices

### Data Privacy
- No sensitive data is stored permanently
- Scan results are kept in memory only
- No personal information is collected
